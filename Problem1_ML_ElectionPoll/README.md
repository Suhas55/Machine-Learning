## Problem 1 : Prediction of Election results, by using multiple ML algorithms and HyperParameter Tunning.
You are hired by one of the leading news channels CNBE who wants to analyze recent elections. This survey was conducted on 1525 voters with 9 variables. You have to build a model, to predict which party a voter will vote for on the basis of the given information, to create an exit poll that will help in predicting overall win and seats covered by a particular party.

Algorithms used : Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis , KNN, Naive Bayes, Bagging, Random forest , Ada Boost
